## Introduction

This project implements a smooth and realistic simulation of a Universal Robots UR3 collaborative robotic arm performing a pick and place operation. The simulation uses ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and visualizes the robot's movements in RViz with high-fidelity 3D mesh models. The primary focus of this project is to achieve ultra-smooth, glitch-free robot motion while maintaining accurate visual representation using detailed mesh files.

The simulation demonstrates a complete pick and place cycle, including approaching an object, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to a new location, placing it down, and returning to the home position. All movements are carefully interpolated using advanced trajectory generation techniques to ensure smooth acceleration and deceleration profiles with zero jerk at critical points.

## System Architecture

The system architecture follows a modular design pattern typical of ROS 2 applications, with clear separation between different functional components:

## Motion Planning and Trajectory Generation

The UR3 robot's motion is controlled using a custom Python node that implements advanced trajectory generation techniques to achieve ultra-smooth, glitch-free motion. This section details the algorithms and approaches used to generate these trajectories.

### Minimum Jerk Trajectory

The core of the smooth motion generation is the minimum jerk trajectory algorithm. This approach generates a trajectory that minimizes the jerk (rate of change of acceleration), resulting in extremely smooth motion with zero velocity and acceleration at endpoints. This is the same type of trajectory used in high-end industrial robots.

The mathematical formula for the minimum jerk trajectory is:

```
s(t) = 10(t/T)³ - 15(t/T)⁴ + 6(t/T)⁵
```

Where:
- `s(t)` is the normalized position at time `t`
- `T` is the total duration of the motion

This trajectory has the following properties:
- `s(0) = 0`, `s(T) = 1` (starts at 0, ends at 1)
- `s'(0) = 0`, `s'(T) = 0` (zero velocity at endpoints)
- `s''(0) = 0`, `s''(T) = 0` (zero acceleration at endpoints)
- `s'''(0) ≠ 0`, `s'''(T) ≠ 0` (non-zero jerk at endpoints, but minimized overall)

The implementation in Python is as follows:

```python
def minimum_jerk(self, t):
    """Minimum jerk trajectory function.
    This produces extremely smooth motion with zero velocity and acceleration at endpoints."""
    return 10 * (t**3) - 15 * (t**4) + 6 * (t**5)
```

This function takes a normalized time value `t` (ranging from 0 to 1) and returns a normalized position value (also ranging from 0 to 1). The actual joint positions are then calculated by interpolating between the start and end positions using this normalized value.

### Key Pose Interpolation

The robot moves through a sequence of predefined key poses that define the pick and place operation. These key poses are defined as arrays of joint angles (in radians) for each of the 6 joints of the UR3 robot.

```python
self.key_poses = [
    # Home position
    [0.0, -1.57, 0.0, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Pre-grasp approach
    [0.5, -1.0, 0.5, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Grasp position
    [0.5, -0.8, 0.8, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Lift
    [0.5, -1.0, 0.5, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Transport
    [-0.5, -1.0, 0.5, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Place position
    [-0.5, -0.8, 0.8, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Post-place retreat
    [-0.5, -1.0, 0.5, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Return to home
    [0.0, -1.57, 0.0, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0]
]
```

The motion between these key poses is interpolated using the minimum jerk trajectory with precise timing control. This approach allows for complex motion sequences to be defined using a small number of key poses, while ensuring smooth transitions between them.

### Dwell Time

To eliminate potential glitches during rapid direction changes, the robot pauses at each key pose for a configurable amount of time (default: 2 seconds). This dwell time gives the robot time to settle and ensures that the motion is visually smooth and realistic.

```python
self.dwell_time = 2.0  # seconds to pause at each pose
```

During the dwell time, the robot maintains the exact joint positions of the key pose, ensuring stability and preventing any unwanted motion.

### Angle Wrapping Handling

One of the challenges in controlling revolute joints is handling angle wrapping. For example, moving from 170° to -170° should result in a 20° movement, not a 340° movement in the opposite direction. The trajectory generator properly handles angle wrapping for revolute joints to ensure the robot always takes the shortest path between poses, preventing unnecessary rotations.

```python
# Calculate the shortest path for revolute joints
diff = end_pos - start_pos
if abs(diff) > math.pi:
    if diff > 0:
        diff = diff - 2 * math.pi
    else:
        diff = diff + 2 * math.pi
    end_pos = start_pos + diff
```

This code checks if the difference between the start and end positions is greater than π radians (180°). If it is, it adjusts the end position to ensure the robot takes the shortest path.

## Control Loop Implementation

The control loop that applies the trajectory to the robot's joints is implemented as a high-frequency timer callback function. This loop runs at 100 Hz (10ms cycle time) to ensure ultra-smooth motion with frequent updates to the robot's position.

```python
def control_loop(self):
    """Main control loop for smooth robot motion"""
    with self.lock:  # Thread safety
        # Update timers
        dt = 0.01  # 10ms (100Hz)

        if self.is_dwelling:
            # We're pausing at a pose
            self.dwell_timer += dt
            if self.dwell_timer >= self.dwell_time:
                # Done dwelling, start moving to next pose
                self.is_dwelling = False
                self.motion_time = 0.0
                self.next_pose_index = (self.current_pose_index + 1) % len(self.key_poses)
        else:
            # We're moving between poses
            self.motion_time += dt

            if self.motion_time >= self.motion_duration:
                # Reached the target pose, start dwelling
                self.current_pose_index = self.next_pose_index
                self.is_dwelling = True
                self.dwell_timer = 0.0

                # Set exact pose values to avoid accumulation of floating point errors
                self.current_positions = self.key_poses[self.current_pose_index].copy()
            else:
                # Interpolate between poses
                t = self.motion_time / self.motion_duration
                smooth_t = self.minimum_jerk(t)

                # Interpolate each joint position
                for i in range(len(self.current_positions)):
                    # Calculate the shortest path for revolute joints
                    start_pos = self.key_poses[self.current_pose_index][i]
                    end_pos = self.key_poses[self.next_pose_index][i]

                    # Handle angle wrapping
                    diff = end_pos - start_pos
                    if abs(diff) > math.pi:
                        if diff > 0:
                            diff = diff - 2 * math.pi
                        else:
                            diff = diff + 2 * math.pi
                        end_pos = start_pos + diff

                    # Apply minimum jerk trajectory
                    self.current_positions[i] = start_pos + smooth_t * (end_pos - start_pos)
```

Key features of the control loop implementation include:

1. **Thread Safety**: The implementation uses thread locks to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data between the control loop and the ROS2 callback functions.

2. **Consistent Timing**: The implementation uses a fixed time increment (`dt = 0.01`) to ensure consistent timing between updates, preventing timing-related glitches.

3. **State Machine**: The control loop implements a simple state machine with two states: dwelling at a pose and moving between poses.

4. **Exact Pose Values**: The system sets exact pose values at the end of each motion segment to avoid accumulation of floating point errors over time.

5. **Smooth Interpolation**: The minimum jerk trajectory function is used to generate smooth interpolation between key poses.

6. **Angle Wrapping Handling**: The control loop properly handles angle wrapping to ensure the robot takes the shortest path between poses.

## ROS2 Architecture

The simulation uses ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the underlying framework for communication, visualization, and control. This section details the ROS2 components used in the project.

### Nodes and Components

The simulation uses the following ROS2 nodes:

1. **robot_state_publisher**: A standard ROS2 node that publishes the robot's state (joint positions) to TF2. This node takes the URDF description of the robot and the current joint positions and publishes the corresponding transforms.

2. **smooth_robot_mover**: A custom Python node that generates and publishes smooth joint trajectories. This node implements the trajectory generation algorithms described above and publishes the resulting joint positions to the `/joint_states` topic.

The relationship between these nodes is illustrated in the following diagram:

```

                  |                   |
                  | smooth_robot_mover|
                  |                   |
                  +--------+----------+
                           |
                           | /joint_states

                           |
                           | /tf, /tf_static
                           v
                     +------------+
                     |            |
                     | TF Tree    |
                     |            |
                     +------------+
```

### Topics and Messages

The simulation uses the following ROS2 topics and message types:

1. **/joint_states** (sensor_msgs/JointState): Joint positions published by the smooth_robot_mover node. This topic contains the current position of each joint of the robot.

2. **/robot_description** (std_msgs/String): URDF description of the robot, published as a string parameter. This description is used by the robot_state_publisher to generate the TF transforms.

3. **/tf** and **/tf_static** (tf2_msgs/TFMessage): Transform frames published by the robot_state_publisher. These topics contain the transforms between the different links of the robot, based on the joint positions and the URDF description.

The JointState message structure is as follows:

```
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
string[] name
float64[] position
float64[] velocity
float64[] effort
```

In this project, only the `name` and `position` fields are used, as the simulation focuses on kinematic motion rather than dynamics.

### Parameters

The simulation uses the following ROS2 parameters:

1. **robot_description**: URDF string parameter used by the robot_state_publisher. This parameter contains the complete URDF description of the robot, including all links, joints, visual meshes, collision meshes, and inertial properties.

2. **use_sim_time**: Boolean parameter that indicates whether to use simulation time or real time. In this project, real time is used, so this parameter is set to `False`.

These parameters are set when launching the nodes, either through command-line arguments or through a launch file.

## Visualization in RViz

The robot is visualized in RViz, which provides a 3D view of the robot and its environment. RViz is a powerful visualization tool that is part of the ROS ecosystem and is widely used for robot visualization and debugging.

The visualization includes:

1. **Robot Model**: The 3D mesh models of the robot's links, loaded from the URDF description.

2. **TF Frames**: The coordinate frames of each link, visualized as axes or arrows.

3. **Joint State Information**: The current position of each joint, visualized through the robot model.

RViz is configured through a configuration file (`simple_config.rviz`) that specifies which displays to show and how to configure them. The key displays used in this project are:

1. **RobotModel**: Displays the robot model based on the URDF description and the current joint states.

2. **TF**: Displays the transform frames of the robot.

3. **Grid**: Displays a reference grid to help with spatial orientation.

## Pick and Place Sequence

The simulated pick and place operation consists of the following steps:

1. **Home Position**: The robot starts in its home position, with all joints at their zero positions except for the shoulder lift and wrist 1 joints, which are at -90 degrees (-1.57 radians).

2. **Pre-Grasp Approach**: The robot moves to a position above the object, with the gripper open and aligned with the object.

3. **Grasp Position**: The robot lowers to the object's position, positioning the gripper around the object.

4. **Grasp**: The robot closes its gripper to grasp the object. In this simulation, the grasp is simulated by a rotation of the wrist 3 joint.

5. **Lift**: The robot lifts the object by moving upward, away from the surface.

6. **Transport**: The robot moves the object to the target location, maintaining the grasp.

7. **Place Position**: The robot lowers the object to the target surface, positioning it at the desired location.

8. **Release**: The robot opens its gripper to release the object. Again, this is simulated by a rotation of the wrist 3 joint.

9. **Post-Place Retreat**: The robot lifts away from the placed object, ensuring it doesn't collide with the object.

10. **Return to Home**: The robot returns to its home position, completing the pick and place cycle.

This sequence is defined through the key poses in the `smooth_robot_mover.py` script and is executed continuously, allowing the robot to repeatedly perform the pick and place operation.

## Executable Script Commands

To run the UR3 robot pick and place simulation, several executable script commands are provided. These commands allow you to start the simulation, visualize the robot, and control its behavior.

### Basic Simulation Launch

The most basic way to launch the simulation is using the provided launch script:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
./launch_ur3_mesh_visualization.sh
```

This script starts all the necessary components: the robot state publisher, the smooth robot mover, and RViz for visualization.

### Running Components Individually

You can also run each component individually for more control:

Terminal 1 (Robot State Publisher):
```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher --ros-args -p robot_description:="$(xacro ur3_absolute_paths_direct.urdf.xacro)"
```

Terminal 2 (Robot Mover):
```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
python3.12 smooth_robot_mover.py
```

Terminal 3 (RViz):
```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
rviz2 -d simple_config.rviz
```

### Customizing the Simulation

You can customize the simulation by modifying the parameters in the `smooth_robot_mover.py` script:

```bash
# Edit the script
nano ~/ros2_workspaces/smooth_robot_mover.py

# After editing, run the simulation
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
./launch_ur3_mesh_visualization.sh
```

Key parameters you might want to modify include:

- `self.key_poses`: The sequence of joint positions that define the pick and place operation
- `self.motion_duration`: The time (in seconds) to move between poses
- `self.dwell_time`: The time (in seconds) to pause at each pose

### Monitoring ROS2 Topics

You can monitor the ROS2 topics to see what's happening in the simulation:

```bash
# Monitor joint states
ros2 topic echo /joint_states

# List all available topics

## Implementation Details

This section provides detailed information about the implementation of the UR3 Robot Pick and Place Simulation, focusing on aspects that ensure robustness, reliability, and performance.

### Thread Safety

The implementation uses thread locks to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data between the control loop and the ROS2 callback functions. This is crucial for preventing race conditions that could lead to erratic robot behavior.

```python
from threading import Lock

class SmoothRobotMover(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('smooth_robot_mover')

        # Create a lock for thread safety
        self.lock = Lock()

        # ... other initialization code ...

    def control_loop(self):
        with self.lock:  # Acquire lock before accessing shared data
            # Update robot state
            # ...

    def publish_joint_states(self):
        with self.lock:  # Acquire lock before accessing shared data
            # Publish current joint positions
            # ...
```

The lock ensures that the control loop and the joint state publisher don't simultaneously access and modify the shared robot state data, which could lead to inconsistent states or data corruption.

### Error Handling

The code includes comprehensive error handling for various scenarios:

1. **Joint Limit Violations**: The code checks if the calculated joint positions exceed the defined limits and clamps them if necessary.

```python
def clamp_joint_position(self, joint_index, position):
    """Clamp joint position to within limits"""
    min_limit = self.joint_limits[joint_index][0]
    max_limit = self.joint_limits[joint_index][1]

    if position < min_limit:
        return min_limit
    elif position > max_limit:
        return max_limit
    else:
        return position
```

2. **Angle Wrapping Issues**: The code properly handles angle wrapping for revolute joints to ensure the robot takes the shortest path.

```python
def shortest_angular_distance(self, from_angle, to_angle):
    """Calculate shortest angular distance between two angles"""
    diff = to_angle - from_angle

    # Handle angle wrapping
    if abs(diff) > math.pi:
        if diff > 0:
            diff = diff - 2 * math.pi
        else:
            diff = diff + 2 * math.pi

    return diff
```

3. **Timing Inconsistencies**: The code uses a fixed time increment to ensure consistent timing between updates, preventing timing-related glitches.

```python
def control_loop(self):
    # Use a fixed time increment
    dt = 0.01  # 10ms (100Hz)
    self.motion_time += dt
```

4. **Exception Handling**: The code includes try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

```python
try:
    # Perform operation that might raise an exception
    # ...
except Exception as e:
    self.get_logger().error(f'Error: {str(e)}')
    # Handle the error or provide a fallback
```

### Performance Optimization

Several optimizations are implemented to ensure smooth motion and efficient execution:

1. **High Control Rate**: The control loop runs at 100 Hz for ultra-smooth motion.

```python
# Create a timer that calls the control loop at 100Hz
self.create_timer(1.0/100.0, self.control_loop)
```

2. **Precomputed Trajectories**: Trajectory parameters are precomputed to minimize computational load during execution.

```python
def precompute_trajectory_parameters(self):
    """Precompute parameters for the trajectory to improve performance"""
    self.trajectory_params = []

    for i in range(len(self.key_poses) - 1):
        start_pose = self.key_poses[i]
        end_pose = self.key_poses[i + 1]

        params = []
        for j in range(len(start_pose)):
            # Calculate shortest path
            diff = self.shortest_angular_distance(start_pose[j], end_pose[j])
            params.append((start_pose[j], diff))

        self.trajectory_params.append(params)
```

3. **Efficient Angle Calculations**: Optimized algorithms for calculating the shortest path between joint angles.

4. **Minimal Memory Allocation**: The code reuses existing arrays and objects where possible to minimize garbage collection overhead.

```python
# Reuse existing message object
self.joint_state_msg.position = self.current_positions
```

5. **Optimized Visualization**: The RViz configuration is optimized to minimize CPU and GPU usage while still providing a clear visualization of the robot.

## Project Setup

### Creating the URDF File

Create a file named `ur3_absolute_paths_direct.urdf.xacro` in your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
nano ur3_absolute_paths_direct.urdf.xacro
```

The URDF file should include the robot's links, joints, visual meshes, collision meshes, and inertial properties. Here's a simplified example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro" name="ur3">
  <!-- Materials -->
  <material name="UR_Blue">
    <color rgba="0.1 0.1 0.8 1.0"/>
  </material>

  <!-- Base Link -->
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <mesh filename="file:///home/lachu/ros2_workspaces/ros2_ws/src/ur3_pick_place/meshes/visual/base.dae"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="UR_Blue"/>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <mesh filename="file:///home/lachu/ros2_workspaces/ros2_ws/src/ur3_pick_place/meshes/collision/base.stl"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="4.0"/>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <inertia ixx="0.00443333156" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="0.00443333156" iyz="0.0" izz="0.0072"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>

  <!-- Additional links and joints would be defined here -->

  <!-- World link -->
  <link name="world"/>

  <joint name="world_joint" type="fixed">
    <parent link="world"/>
    <child link="base_link"/>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
  </joint>
</robot>
```

### Creating the Robot Mover Script

Create a file named `smooth_robot_mover.py` in your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
nano smooth_robot_mover.py
```

Here's a simplified version of the script:

```python

    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x smooth_robot_mover.py
```

### Creating a Launch Script

Create a file named `launch_ur3_mesh_visualization.sh` in your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
nano launch_ur3_mesh_visualization.sh
```

Add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source ROS2 environment
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

# Kill any existing processes
pkill -f "rviz2" || true
pkill -f "robot_state_publisher" || true
pkill -f "smooth_robot_mover.py" || true

# Wait for processes to terminate
sleep 2

# Start the robot state publisher with the mesh URDF
ros2 run robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher --ros-args -p robot_description:="$(xacro ur3_absolute_paths_direct.urdf.xacro)" &
ROBOT_STATE_PUBLISHER_PID=$!

# Wait for the robot state publisher to start
sleep 3

# Start the robot mover
python3.12 smooth_robot_mover.py &
ROBOT_MOVER_PID=$!

# Wait for the robot mover to start
sleep 3

# Start RViz2
rviz2 -d simple_config.rviz &
RVIZ_PID=$!

# Wait for RViz2 to start
sleep 3

echo "All components started successfully!"
echo "Robot State Publisher PID: $ROBOT_STATE_PUBLISHER_PID"
echo "Robot Mover PID: $ROBOT_MOVER_PID"
echo "RViz2 PID: $RVIZ_PID"

# Wait for user to press Ctrl+C
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop all components"
wait $RVIZ_PID

# Kill all components
kill $ROBOT_STATE_PUBLISHER_PID $ROBOT_MOVER_PID $RVIZ_PID || true
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x launch_ur3_mesh_visualization.sh
```

### Creating an RViz Configuration

Create a file named `simple_config.rviz` in your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
nano simple_config.rviz
```

You can generate this file by running RViz once and saving the configuration, or use a basic configuration that includes:
- Global Options: Fixed Frame set to "world"
- RobotModel display with Description Topic set to "/robot_description"
- TF display

## Running the Simulation

### Method 1: Using the Launch Script

```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
./launch_ur3_mesh_visualization.sh
```

This script starts all the necessary components: the robot state publisher, the smooth robot mover, and RViz for visualization.

### Method 2: Running Components Individually

Open three terminal windows:

Terminal 1 (Robot State Publisher):
```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher --ros-args -p robot_description:="$(xacro ur3_absolute_paths_direct.urdf.xacro)"
```

Terminal 2 (Robot Mover):
```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
python3.12 smooth_robot_mover.py
```

Terminal 3 (RViz):
```bash
cd ~/ros2_workspaces
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
rviz2 -d simple_config.rviz
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mesh Files Not Displaying

**Error**: Robot appears as simple shapes instead of detailed meshes.

**Symptoms**:
- Robot appears as basic geometric shapes (cylinders, boxes) instead of detailed meshes
- RViz console shows warnings about missing mesh files
- Error messages like "Could not load resource [mesh file path]"

**Solutions**:
- Check that the mesh file paths in the URDF are correct and point to existing files
  ```bash
  # Verify mesh files exist
  ls -la ~/ros2_workspaces/ros2_ws/src/ur3_pick_place/meshes/visual/
  ls -la ~/ros2_workspaces/ros2_ws/src/ur3_pick_place/meshes/collision/
  ```

- Ensure the mesh files have the correct permissions
  ```bash
  # Set correct permissions
  chmod 644 ~/ros2_workspaces/ros2_ws/src/ur3_pick_place/meshes/visual/*.dae
  chmod 644 ~/ros2_workspaces/ros2_ws/src/ur3_pick_place/meshes/collision/*.stl
  ```

- Try using absolute file paths with the `file://` prefix in the URDF
  ```xml
  <mesh filename="file:///home/lachu/ros2_workspaces/ros2_ws/src/ur3_pick_place/meshes/visual/base.dae"/>
  ```

- Check RViz settings: ensure "Visual Enabled" is checked in the RobotModel display
  1. In RViz, select the "RobotModel" display in the left panel
  2. Make sure "Visual Enabled" is checked
  3. Set "Description Topic" to "/robot_description"

- Verify that the mesh files are in the correct format
  ```bash
  # Check file types

### Glitchy Robot Movement

**Error**: Robot movement is jerky or has sudden jumps.

**Symptoms**:
- Robot motion appears jerky or stutters during movement
- Sudden jumps or teleportations between positions
- Inconsistent speed during motion
- Joint angles occasionally appear to "flip" or take the long way around

**Solutions**:

- Increase the publishing rate in the robot mover script
  ```python
  # Change from 50Hz to 100Hz or higher
  self.create_timer(1.0/100.0, self.publish_joint_states)
  ```

- Increase the number of interpolation points between waypoints
  ```python
  # Increase interpolation steps
  self.interpolation_steps = 500  # More steps for smoother motion
  ```

- Use a smoother interpolation function (e.g., minimum jerk trajectory)
  ```python
  def minimum_jerk(self, t):
      """Minimum jerk trajectory function.
      This produces extremely smooth motion with zero velocity and acceleration at endpoints."""
      return 10 * (t**3) - 15 * (t**4) + 6 * (t**5)
  ```

- Add thread safety with locks to prevent race conditions
  ```python
  from threading import Lock

  # In __init__
  self.lock = Lock()

  # In methods that access shared data
  with self.lock:
      # Access shared data here
  ```

- Ensure consistent timing in the control loop
  ```python
  # Use a fixed time increment
  dt = 0.01  # 10ms (100Hz)
  self.motion_time += dt
  ```

### RViz Crashes

**Error**: RViz crashes when trying to display the robot.

**Solutions**:
- Check for errors in the URDF file
- Ensure the mesh files are in the correct format
- Reduce the complexity of the mesh files
- Update your graphics drivers
- Increase the memory available to RViz

### Robot State Publisher Errors

**Error**: Robot state publisher fails to start or publish transforms.

**Solutions**:
- Check the URDF for syntax errors
- Ensure all joint names in the URDF match those used in the joint states message
- Check that the robot_description parameter is being set correctly
- Verify that the TF tree is complete and connected

### Python Script Errors

**Error**: The robot mover script fails to run or has runtime errors.

**Solutions**:
- Check Python version compatibility (script requires Python 3.12)
- Ensure all required Python packages are installed
- Check for syntax errors in the script
- Verify that the joint names match those in the URDF
- Check the ROS2 node initialization and shutdown procedures

## Customizing the Simulation

### Modifying the Robot's Motion

To change the robot's motion pattern, edit the `key_poses` list in the `smooth_robot_mover.py` file:

```python
self.key_poses = [
    # Home position
    [0.0, -1.57, 0.0, -1.57, 0.0, 0.0],

    # Add or modify poses here
    # Format: [joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4, joint5, joint6]
]
```

Each pose is defined as a list of 6 joint angles in radians, corresponding to the 6 joints of the UR3 robot:
1. `shoulder_pan_joint`: Rotation of the base (around Z axis)
2. `shoulder_lift_joint`: Shoulder joint (around Y axis)
3. `elbow_joint`: Elbow joint (around Y axis)
4. `wrist_1_joint`: First wrist joint (around Y axis)
5. `wrist_2_joint`: Second wrist joint (around Z axis)
6. `wrist_3_joint`: Third wrist joint (around Y axis)

You can add as many poses as needed to create complex motion sequences. For example, to add a new pose where the robot reaches higher:

```python
# Reach high pose
[0.0, -0.5, 0.3, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
```

### Adjusting Motion Parameters

To make the motion faster, slower, or smoother, adjust these parameters in the script:

```python
# Speed control
self.motion_duration = 8.0  # seconds to move between poses (increase for slower motion)
self.dwell_time = 2.0  # seconds to pause at each pose

# Smoothness control
self.create_timer(1.0/100.0, self.control_loop)  # control loop frequency (Hz)
```

For ultra-smooth motion, you can also adjust the trajectory generation parameters:

```python
# Use a different smoothing function
def custom_smoothing(self, t):
    # Sigmoid function for even smoother transitions
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + math.exp(-12 * (t - 0.5)))
```

### Using Different Mesh Files

To use different mesh files, update the file paths in the URDF file:

```xml
<mesh filename="file:///path/to/your/mesh/file.dae"/>
```

You can use mesh files from different robot models or create your own custom meshes. Supported formats include:
- `.dae` (COLLADA) for visual meshes
- `.stl` (STereoLithography) for collision meshes

When creating custom meshes, ensure they:
- Have the correct scale (meters)
- Use the correct coordinate system (Z-up for URDF)
- Have proper origins aligned with joint axes

### Changing Robot Colors

To change the robot's appearance, modify the material definitions in the URDF:

```xml
<material name="UR_Blue">
  <color rgba="0.1 0.1 0.8 1.0"/>
</material>

<!-- Add new materials -->
<material name="UR_Red">
  <color rgba="0.8 0.1 0.1 1.0"/>
</material>
```

Then apply the material to specific links:

```xml
<visual>
  <geometry>
    <mesh filename="file:///path/to/mesh.dae"/>
  </geometry>
  <material name="UR_Red"/>
</visual>
```

### Adding Environment Objects

To add objects to the environment (like tables, objects to pick, etc.), add new links to the URDF:

```xml
<link name="table">
  <visual>
    <origin xyz="0 0 -0.5" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <geometry>
      <box size="1.0 1.0 0.05"/>
    </geometry>
    <material name="Grey"/>
  </visual>
  <collision>
    <origin xyz="0 0 -0.5" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <geometry>
      <box size="1.0 1.0 0.05"/>
    </geometry>
  </collision>
</link>

<joint name="world_to_table" type="fixed">
  <parent link="world"/>
  <child link="table"/>
  <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
</joint>
```

## Advanced Usage

### Adding Collision Detection

To add collision detection, you can integrate the simulation with MoveIt:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-moveit
```

### Recording the Simulation

To record the simulation as a video:

```bash
# Install required packages
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Record the screen
ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -i :0.0 -r 30 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 0 output.mp4
```

### Exporting Joint Trajectories

To export the joint trajectories for use in a real robot:

```bash
# Record joint states to a bag file
ros2 bag record /joint_states
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to the simulation include:

1. **Collision Detection**: Adding collision detection to avoid obstacles
2. **Dynamic Object Interaction**: Simulating the physics of object interaction
3. **Path Planning**: Implementing advanced path planning algorithms like RRT or PRM
4. **Inverse Kinematics**: Adding inverse kinematics for end-effector positioning
5. **Gazebo Integration**: Extending the simulation to Gazebo for physics-based simulation
6. **MoveIt Integration**: Using MoveIt for advanced motion planning
